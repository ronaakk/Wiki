# Framework
A framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a foundation, so you're not starting entirely from scratch. Frameworks are typically associated with a specific programming language and are suited to different types of tasks.

Let's say you're building a house. You could pour the foundation and frame the house yourself. It would take a lot of time, but you could do it. If all of that were already done for you, though, it would save you quite a bit of effort â€” especially if it was done by expert home builders.

In software development, a framework serves a similar purpose. It's designed and tested by other Software Developers and Engineers, so you know it's a solid foundation.

A house isn't complete with just the framework, though. Similarly, a framework in software development is a starting point, but you add higher-level functionality to it to make it work.

Below, is a closer look at frameworks, what they're used for, the differences between libraries and frameworks, and more.

## Why do we use frameworks?
Using frameworks saves time and reduces the risk of errors. You don't need to write everything from the ground up, so there's less chance of introducing errors. Plus, frameworks have already been tested, so there's less to worry about. Other advantages include:

* More secure code
* Simpler testing and debugging
* Avoiding duplicate code
* Clean and easily adaptable code
* Able to focus on writing code specific to the project
* Can be extended
